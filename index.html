            <p>This project started in March 2020 where I spent my time with two 4’x8’ patches of land in central Indiana. For several days, I hacked at the ground with an energy that I don’t believe came from within myself. I think the willingness for plants to be domesticated into a garden is an incredibly generous entity that provides a sense of meaning and wholeness to human life. Then the ache I kept feeling to go back to the garden was one that was entirely unfamiliar. I documented my thoughts when I was in the garden and when I was away from it. I made a point to indulge in what was interesting to me. What exists now is a garden well under way for the growing season, and a series of photos, drawings, poems, and thoughts that try to grasp at the following questions:
                What draws me to the garden?
                What is my relationship witht the land?
                What kind of relationship do I want to have with the land?
                How do I reconcile that with my actions?
                How do we cultivate garden ethics?</p>

                <p>>all that is left are chives, chives,
                    chive migration.
                    chive multiplication
                    spotted in the front yard
                    and swept into the kitchen

                    always minced into dumplings
                easily scrambled with eggs
                sometimes smashed among potatoes

                the rabbits complain that
                the smell is too strong
                and the HOA only has eyes for Blue
                quick get the shovels
                it’s dig day
