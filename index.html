                    <p>This project started in March 2020 where I spent my time with two 4’x8’ patches of land in central Indiana. For several days, I hacked at the ground with an energy that I don’t believe came from within myself. I think the willingness for plants to be domesticated into a garden is an incredibly generous entity that provides a sense of meaning and wholeness to human life. Then the ache I kept feeling to go back to the garden was one that was entirely unfamiliar. I documented my thoughts when I was in the garden and when I was away from it. I made a point to indulge in what was interesting to me. What exists now is a garden well under way for the growing season, and a series of photos, drawings, poems, and thoughts that try to grasp at the following questions:<br>
                    What draws me to the garden?<br>
                    What is my relationship witht the land?<br>
                    What kind of relationship do I want to have with the land?<br>
                    How do I reconcile that with my actions?<br>
                    How do we cultivate garden ethics?</p>

                        what’s the difference?
                            wait i don’t even know if this will work
                                but if I start now, they’ll have to stay in these pots for 2 months
                                    but will they even grow?
                                        Does that mean I need a grow light?
                                            I’m taking too long
                                                ok any of this will probably work
                                                    OH but I need it to work
                                                        this looks familiar, I’ll get it

            <p>The idea to start a compost bin is a couple summers old at this point. Selfishly old. As in, the reward at the time was not glamorous enough to motivate us. As in, there wasn’t an apparant use for compost, and reducing our hosuehold trash volume did not yield a tangible reward. But now that there’s a garden to use the finished compost on, we’ve started to close the loop--kitchen to compost bin to garden and back to the kitchen.</p>

            <p>Please quit leaving the compost on my kitchen counter!<br>
                Can we compost these melon peels?<br>
                What about the eggshells?<br>
                
                No, we can’t compost the aluminum can.<br>
                现在我们全家就围着这个垃圾桶转。 <br>

                pop! this plant is too powerful<br>
                So the whole family got up to rid the lawn of them. Quickly! Before the seeds mature. Good thing the weeds didn’t have deep roots.<br>
                A great loss.

                the way of gardenache is<br>
                how I once planted a dandelion thinking it would grow<br>
                for me.<br>
                of course it did not grow,<br>
                for dandelion does not respond to summoning.<br>
                remain silent and one may find you at your doorstep.<br>
                dig it out and the roots will burrow deeper.<br>
                two dandelions before next Tuesday<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                gardenache comes<br>
                with a ringing in the left ear.<br>
                remedy with the crumbling of soil clumps between the fingertips, then<br>
                indulge in the desire to build a garden.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                when the soil becomes too fine to pinch,<br>
                study the motion of an earthworm to<br>
                remedy the elasticity of your doubt.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                the first sprout will give you a moment of relief<br>
                that a sum of money and eleven meals of calories<br>
                have not been wasted,<br>
                and that the earth you poked and scraped and tore and hacked at<br>
                is intensely forgiving<br>
                as long as you listen.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p> 
                so when the ringing creeps into to the right ear,<br>
                return to dandelion for advice.
